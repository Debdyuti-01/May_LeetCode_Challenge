You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. 
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Note:S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

Sample :
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3



*****Solution using Java *****

class Solution 
{
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S)
    {
        
        char[] Jarray=J.toCharArray();
        char[] Sarray=S.toCharArray();
        int[] array=new int[128];
        
        int count=0;
        
        
        for( char i:Sarray)
        {
            array[i]++;
        }
        
        for(char i:Jarray)
        {
            count+=array[i];
        }
        
        return count;
        
    }
}
